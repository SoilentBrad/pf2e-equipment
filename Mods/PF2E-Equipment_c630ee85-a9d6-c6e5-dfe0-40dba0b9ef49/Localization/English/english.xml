  <content contentuid="h834fb3ddg4056gc4c9g9e13ga1082963ff03" version="5">This item appears to be an ordinary semiprecious stone and is typically mounted on a brooch or ring, but the stone is, in fact, an eyeball. This illusion can be seen through with true seeing or similar magic, and anyone who interacts with the item feels its wet and sticky surface, allowing them to attempt to disbelieve the illusion (DC 19). Many hags claim a hag eye is more effective if plucked from a living, awake creature, but this is likely just a convenient excuse for sadism.&lt;br&gt;The hag eye produces no direct benefit for the wearer, but allows the hag who created it, or any member of her coven, can peer through the eye using the Seek action. This has no range limit, provided the hag is on the same plane.</content>

When a lure is attached to a combat fishing pole, it can be used to make thrown weapon attacks with a range increment of 20 feet, though the lure must then be reeled back in with an Interact action before the weapon can be used at range again (see the tethered trait). The ranged trip, tethered, thrown, and versatile P traits of the combat fishing pole only apply to thrown attacks made with a lure; throwing the pole itself leaves you with no practical way to retrieve it other than moving to its location and picking it up. A combat fishing pole can be used alongside fishing tackle to fish, and it adds its item bonus from weapon potency runes (if any) as an item bonus on checks to fish when used in this manner.</content>

  <content contentuid="h50414c98g2586g0ac6gb5f5gb83c14259c42" version="1">The combat fishing pole is a sturdy and flexible pole that can be used as a weapon in melee. When a lure is attached to a combat fishing pole, it can be used to make thrown weapon attacks with a range increment of 20 feet, though the lure must then be reeled back in with an Interact action before the weapon can be used at range again (see the tethered trait). The ranged trip, tethered, thrown, and versatile P traits of the combat fishing pole only apply to thrown attacks made with a lure; throwing the pole itself leaves you with no practical way to retrieve it other than moving to its location and picking it up. A combat fishing pole can be used alongside fishing tackle to fish, and it adds its item bonus from weapon potency runes (if any) as an item bonus on checks to fish when used in this manner.</content>

On a critical hit, a creature in contact with a solid surface becomes stuck to the surface and immobilized for 1 round, and a creature flying via wings has its wings tangled, causing it to fall safely to the ground and become unable to Fly again for 1 round. Glue bombs aren't effective when used on a creature that's in water.</content>

While wearing this crown, you gain a +1 item bonus to Diplomacy checks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Activate&lt;/b&gt; [2 Actions] (concentrate, manipulate); &lt;b&gt;Frequency&lt;/b&gt; once per day; &lt;b&gt;Effect&lt;/b&gt; You bow to an ally within 30 feet, creating a magical bond between the two of you as if you cast &lt;i&gt;share life&lt;/i&gt; targeting the ally. The link remains even if you move more than 30 feet away from them. At the end of the spell’s duration, your ally recovers 4d8 Hit Points and you recover half of what they recover.</content>

  <content contentuid="hc3b70f01g4ec7g9a11ga820g5076f9de49b9" version="1">This item appears to be an ordinary semiprecious stone and is typically mounted on a brooch or ring, but the stone is, in fact, an eyeball. This illusion can be seen through with true seeing or similar magic, and anyone who interacts with the item feels its wet and sticky surface, allowing them to attempt to disbelieve the illusion (DC 19). Many hags claim a hag eye is more effective if plucked from a living, awake creature, but this is likely just a convenient excuse for sadism.&lt;br&gt;The hag eye produces no direct benefit for the wearer, but allows the hag who created it, or any member of her coven, can peer through the eye using the Seek action. This has no range limit, provided the hag is on the same plane.</content>
